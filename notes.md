Event Listeners
All DOM elements support the ability to attach a function that gets called when an event occurs on the element. These functions are called event listeners. Here is an example of an event listener that gets called when an element gets clicked.

const submitDataEl = document.querySelector('#submitData');
submitDataEl.addEventListener('click', function (event) {
  console.log(event.type);
});
There are lots of possible events that you can add a listener to. This includes things like mouse, keyboard, scrolling, animation, video, audio, WebSocket, and clipboard events. You can see the full list on MDN. Here are a few of the more commonly used events.

Event Category	Description
Clipboard	Cut, copied, pasted
Focus	An element gets focus
Keyboard	Keys are pressed
Mouse	Click events
Text selection	When text is selected
You can also add event listeners directly in the HTML. For example, here is a onclick handler that is attached to a button.

<button onclick='alert("clicked")'>click me</button>

When the -la parameter is specified for the ls command in the console (Unix-based systems like Linux or macOS), the following is true:

-l (long listing format): This option displays detailed information about each file or directory. The output includes:

File type and permissions
Number of hard links
Owner of the file
Group the file belongs to
File size
Last modification date and time
File or directory name
-a (all files): This option includes hidden files in the listing (files or directories whose names start with a dot .). Without this option, hidden files are not shown.

Combined Effect:
When ls -la is used, it lists all files (including hidden ones) in the current directory with detailed information about each file.

Example output of ls -la:
sql
drwxr-xr-x  2 user group 4096 Oct 13 10:15 .
drwxr-xr-x 10 user group 4096 Oct 13 09:00 ..
-rw-r--r--  1 user group   45 Oct 13 10:10 .hiddenfile
-rw-r--r--  1 user group  512 Oct 13 10:15 file1.txt
-rwxr-xr-x  1 user group 2048 Oct 13 10:14 script.sh
So, ls -la shows:

All files, including hidden ones.
Detailed file information (permissions, ownership, size, modification time, etc.).
